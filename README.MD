## What's this?

Just a little demo that proves out some functionality we need for Cartology.

 - store file metadata in GCS (not needed, just a spike)
 - upload, search, move files in google drive

**Important** before running, you will need to do the following

`gcloud auth login --enable-gdrive-access --update-adc`
